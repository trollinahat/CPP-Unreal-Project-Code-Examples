# CPP-Unreal-Project-Code-Examples
Example of a project from a class this year at SNHU. This focused on working with assets, materials and shaders at runtime.

Some code was written for a custom projectile that would apply a decal on hit (paintball), but this wasn't finished due to time constraints.
